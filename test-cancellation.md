# Calendar Cancellation Fix - Test Instructions

## Fixed Issues

✅ **UID Consistency**: Cancellation events now use the exact same UID as the original invite
✅ **SEQUENCE Handling**: Proper sequence increment (original: 0 → cancel: 1)
✅ **METHOD & STATUS**: Correctly set METHOD:CANCEL and STATUS:CANCELLED
✅ **Organizer Consistency**: Organizer email matches between original and cancellation
✅ **Event Time Consistency**: DTSTART and DTEND match original event values
✅ **MIME Headers**: Added Content-Class for Outlook compatibility
✅ **CRLF Line Endings**: Proper \r\n formatting per iCalendar spec
✅ **Logging**: Added traceability logs with UID, SEQUENCE, recipients, and status

## Test the Fix

### 1. Send Original Meeting Invite

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/send-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": ["test@dit.daikin.co.jp"],
    "subject": "Test Meeting - Please Cancel",
    "body": "This is a test meeting that will be cancelled",
    "isHtml": true,
    "calendarEvent": {
      "uid": "test-meeting-123@dit.daikin.co.jp",
      "summary": "Test Meeting - Please Cancel",
      "description": "This meeting will be cancelled to test the fix",
      "location": "Conference Room A",
      "start": "2025-01-20T10:00:00.000Z",
      "end": "2025-01-20T11:00:00.000Z",
      "method": "REQUEST",
      "sequence": 0
    }
  }'
```

### 2. Cancel the Meeting

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cancel-meeting \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "uid": "test-meeting-123@dit.daikin.co.jp",
    "summary": "Test Meeting - Please Cancel",
    "description": "This meeting will be cancelled to test the fix",
    "location": "Conference Room A",
    "start": "2025-01-20T10:00:00.000Z",
    "end": "2025-01-20T11:00:00.000Z",
    "attendees": ["test@dit.daikin.co.jp"],
    "sequence": 0,
    "reason": "Testing the cancellation fix",
    "organizer": {
      "name": "DEDE_SYSTEM",
      "email": "DEDE_SYSTEM@dit.daikin.co.jp"
    }
  }'
```

## Expected Results

### Outlook
- Meeting should be automatically removed from calendar
- Cancellation notification email received
- No manual action required from user

### Google Calendar
- Meeting should be automatically removed from calendar
- Cancellation notification email received
- Event status shows as cancelled

### Logs
Check console for entries like:
```
[CALENDAR_REQUEST] UID: test-meeting-123@dit.daikin.co.jp, SEQUENCE: 0, Recipients: test@dit.daikin.co.jp, Status: SENT, MessageID: ...
[CANCELLATION] UID: test-meeting-123@dit.daikin.co.jp, SEQUENCE: 1, Recipients: test@dit.daikin.co.jp, Status: SENT, MessageID: ...
```

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Fixed UID Consistency**: `cancel-meeting/route.ts:line44` - Now accepts and uses the original UID
2. **Proper SEQUENCE Handling**: `calendar.ts:line290` - Increments sequence correctly for cancellations
3. **Enhanced MIME Headers**: `cancel-meeting/route.ts:line95-98` - Added Content-Class header for Outlook
4. **Dual Attachment Strategy**: Both inline and attachment .ics files for better compatibility
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed logs for troubleshooting
6. **Organizer Matching**: Ensures the same organizer email is used for cancellations

## Troubleshooting

If cancellations still don't work:

1. Check logs for UID/SEQUENCE values
2. Verify organizer email matches exactly
3. Ensure SMTP headers are being sent correctly
4. Test with different email clients
5. Verify the original meeting was actually added to calendar first
